# Copyparty Grid Video Player

Play any video in the copyparty grid view using just a single JavaScript file and a video.

## How to use

1. Copy `badapple.js` into a folder on your copyparty server (it doesn't have to be empty).
2. Click the π-symbol below the file view.
3. Enter `import("[path to where you are]/badapple.js")` and click OK.
4. Enter the path to the video you want to play (Use `./` for files in the same folder).
5. Enter a zoom anmount. This can be any number above 0, you can omit the "%" if you want.
> [!NOTE]
> If the video lags to much, try to increase the zoom. This way less files have to be created and updated.
6. Enter a name for the files, you can also leave this empty.
7. Done! :tada:
